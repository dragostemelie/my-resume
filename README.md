# My Resume and Portfolio Website

This repository contains the source code for my personal website that showcases my resume and portfolio of apps I've worked on over the years. The website is built using Next.js and follows a vanilla approach, without the use of any external libraries, except for Next.js built-in functions.

## Technologies Used

- Next.js: A React framework for building static and server-side rendered applications.
- HTML/CSS: Vanilla HTML and CSS are used for styling and layout purposes.
- TypeScript: The website utilizes TypeScript for interactivity and functionality.

## Design File
